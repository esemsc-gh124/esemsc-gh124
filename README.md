# About this account
This account is used for my MSc (Master's) study at Imperial College London.

*THIS IS NOT MY MAIN ACCOUNT.* Its creation is for the department policy that I am recommended to have a dedicated account for my MSc.

# Where are my repositories?
Almost all repositories, from course repos to my assignment submissions, are private and often under our Ada Lovelace Academy organisation.

## Published some
However, I am really proud of some of them, and want to publish them. Agreed by those who are concerned, I published them in my main GitHub account.
